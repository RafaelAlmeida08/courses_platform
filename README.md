This is a project to Moat PHP test.

## How to use it?
After cloning the project you must open your terminal and run the following commands:

1 - php bin/console doctrine:database:create

2 - php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

Those commands will create the database and migrate the database to the database specified.
We are using the SQLITE database to make it simple.
